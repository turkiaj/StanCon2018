## Modeling the Effects of Nutrition with Mixed-Effect Bayesian Network

This work proposes Mixed-Effect Bayesian Network (MEBN) as a method for modeling the effects of nutrition. It allows to identify both typical and personal correlations between nutrients and their bodily responses. Predicting a personal network of nutritional reactions would allow interesting applications at personal diets and in understanding this complex system. Brief theory of MEBN is given followed by implementation in R and Stan. A real life dataset from a nutritional Sysdimet study is then analyzed with the method and the results are visualized with an interactive JavaScript-visualization.

## Contents

Main body of the presentation is found here as fully functional RMarkdown notebook, and also HTML and PDF renderitions of it. The notebook uses my R-package "MEBN" for constructing a Mixed-Effect Bayesian Network that models the effects of nutrition from a real life nutritional dataset. The fully Bayesian estimation of the local mixed-effect models at the network is done with Stan. Visualization of the network is created with JavaScript library sigma.js and some customizations of it.
